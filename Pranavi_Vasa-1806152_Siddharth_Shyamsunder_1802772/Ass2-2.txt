Q2. a)
From the below 2 sentences

S4. An bear eat an squirrel
S5. The dogs eats

Sentence 4 is gramatically incorrect because:
An cannot appear before a word that does not start with a vowel.
considering bear as a single entity we will have to use the word eats instead of eat.

Hence the grammatically correct sentence is:
'A bear eats a squirrel.

Sentence 5 is grammatically incorrect because:
here dogs is considered as a collective noun, hence the word eat will be used instead of eats.

Hence the grammatically correct sentence is:
'The dogs eat'

Q2. b)
For the 2 Sentences we have grammar:
Grammar with 39 productions (start state = S)
    S -> NP VP
    NP -> Det Nom
    NP -> PropN
    NP -> NP PP
    Nom -> Adj Nom
    Nom -> N
    VP -> VP PP
    VP -> V
    VP -> V NP
    VP -> V S
    PP -> P NP
    PropN -> 'Bill'
    Det -> 'the'
    Det -> 'a'
    Det -> 'an'
    N -> 'bear'
    N -> 'squirrel'
    N -> 'park'
    N -> 'river'
    N -> 'dog'
    Adj -> 'angry'
    Adj -> 'frightened'
    V -> 'chased'
    V -> 'saw'
    V -> 'put'
    V -> 'eats'
    V -> 'eat'
    V -> 'chase'
    P -> 'on'
    P -> 'in'
    S -> VP
    Det -> 'A'
    Det -> 'An'
    Det -> 'The'
    V -> 'chases'
    Adj -> 'furry'
    N -> 'dogs'
    N -> 'cat'
    P -> 'along'


The output of the 2 parsers are:

Warning: VP -> VP PP will never be used


For the 4th sentence S4( an bear eat an squirrel ) using chart parser we have:

(S
  (NP (Det an) (Nom (N bear)))
  (VP (V eat) (NP (Det an) (Nom (N squirrel)))))


For the 5th sentence S5( the dogs eats ) using chart parser we have:

(S (NP (Det the) (Nom (N dogs))) (VP (V eats)))


For the 4th sentence S4( an bear eat an squirrel ) using Shift Reduce Parser we have:




For the 5th sentence S5( the dogs eats ) using Shift Reduce Parser we have:

(S (NP (Det the) (Nom (N dogs))) (VP (V eats)))

From the above 2 parsers, we can notice that the chart parser gives us the correct results, whereas the Shift Reduce Parser provides 
us with a blank answer for S4. This is because Chart Parser being a Top Down Parser, has the ability of choice to decide, which grammar
can be the optimal solution or the best fit for the next leaf node. 

The Shift Reduce Parser on the other hand is a BottomUp Parser and hence, it has a Look Ahead variable that traverses through the leaf
 nodes, and calculates every possible outcome of grammar before pointing to the next leaf in iteration, hence in this case, will spot 
any grammar, which will never be used. 

Q2(c)  

Consider we have 2  correct Sentences S6 and S7 and 2 incorrect sentences S8 and S9 as below:

s6="a bear chases a dog"
s7="a dog eats a squirrel along the river"
s8="an bear chases an cat"
s9="an furry squirrel eats"



  
For the 6th sentence S6( a bear chases a dog )(a correct sentence) using uncorrected grammar we have:

(S
  (NP (Det a) (Nom (N bear)))
  (VP (V chases) (NP (Det a) (Nom (N dog)))))


For the 7th sentence S7( a dog eats a squirrel along the river ) (a correct sentence)using uncorrected grammar we have:

(S
  (NP (Det a) (Nom (N dog)))
  (VP
    (VP (V eats) (NP (Det a) (Nom (N squirrel))))
    (PP (P along) (NP (Det the) (Nom (N river))))))
(S
  (NP (Det a) (Nom (N dog)))
  (VP
    (V eats)
    (NP
      (NP (Det a) (Nom (N squirrel)))
      (PP (P along) (NP (Det the) (Nom (N river)))))))


For the 8th sentence S8( an bear chases an cat )(an incorrect sentence) using uncorrected grammar we have:

(S
  (NP (Det an) (Nom (N bear)))
  (VP (V chases) (NP (Det an) (Nom (N cat)))))


For the 9th sentence S9( an furry squirrel eats )(an incorrect sentence) using uncorrected grammar we have:

(S (NP (Det an) (Nom (Adj furry) (Nom (N squirrel)))) (VP (V eats)))

After correcting grammar we have:
Grammar with 39 productions (start state = S)
    S -> NP VP
    NP -> Det Nom
    NP -> PropN
    NP -> NP PP
    Nom -> Adj Nom

    Det -> 'The'
    V -> 'chases'
    Adj -> 'furry'

    N -> 'cat'
    P -> 'along'

The included grammar is: S -> VP
Det -> 'A'
Det1 -> 'an'|'An'
Det2 -> 'the'|'The'
V1 -> 'chases'|'eats'
Adj -> 'furry'
N -> 'dog'|'cat'
N1 -> 'dogs'|'cats'|'elephants'|'squirrels'|'bears'
N2 -> 'elephant'
P -> 'along'
Nom1 -> adj Nom1 | N1
Nom2 -> adj Nom2 | N2
NP -> Det2 Nom1| Det1 Nom2|Det2 Nom2|Det2 Nom
VP ->V1 | V1 NP | V1 S





For the 6th sentence S6( a bear chases a dog )(a correct sentence) using corrected grammar we have:

(S
  (NP (Det a) (Nom (N bear)))
  (VP (V1 chases) (NP (Det a) (Nom (N dog)))))


For the 7th sentence S7( a dog eats a squirrel along the river )(a correct sentence)using corrected grammar we have:

(S

    (NP
      (NP (Det a) (Nom (N squirrel)))
      (PP (P along) (NP (Det2 the) (Nom (N river)))))))


For the 8th sentence S8( an bear chases an cat )(an incorrect sentence) using corrected grammar we have:



For the 9th sentence S9( an furry squirrel eats )(an incorrect sentence) using corrected grammar we have:



Here it is noticed that the grammar will only give results for correct sentences, hence we have no result for the 8th and 9th Sentence, as 
they are incorrect sentences.
