From the above 2 parser results, wecan clearly say the Shift Reduce Parser detects the abiguity in the sentences. Also as we can see 
from the Earley Chart Parser, we can notice 5 derivations for each of these sentences, and since the sentence can be interpreted
in multiple ways, it is considered ambiguous. 

Also since the Shift Reduce Parser works only on unambiguous data, we have no entries in the results using Shift Reduce Parser.
