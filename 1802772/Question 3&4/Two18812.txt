#We ask User to input whether he wants to input text or URL.

Getting Phone Numbers from text:
#If choice =text we input text from user, and store the Regular Expression pattern in reg
#phone traverses the text and finds if a pattern matching reg is found, if so, it displays the text following the pattern
#We display contents in the phone variable

Getting PhoneNumbers from URL:
#If user wishes to enter URL, we ask user to enter URL  
#We use urlopen to open that URL, and we decode and store the URL value in rw in html format
#We import Beautiful Soup to extract Meaningful Data from the pattern.
#phone traverses the text and finds if a pattern matching reg is found, if so, it displays the text following the pattern
